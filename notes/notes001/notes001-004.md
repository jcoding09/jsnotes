# Topic 004: Concept refresher

## 1. Redeclaration of variable

```javascript
let a = 3;
console.log(a);
let a = 5;
console.log(a);
```

In JavaScript, you cannot declare the same variable twice using `let` within the same scope. If you try to do so, it will result in a syntax error. So, the code you provided will throw an error at the second `let a = 5` declaration.

To fix this, you can either change the second `let a = 5` to just `a = 5`, or if you want to redeclare `a`, you would use `var` or `const` for the first declaration and `let` for the second. Here's the corrected version:

```javascript
let a = 3;
console.log(a);
a = 5; // Reassigning the value of 'a'
console.log(a);
```

This will output:

```
3
5
```

## 2. concatenation and unary

1. `console.log(3 + "3")`: This will output `"33"`. When you use the `+` operator with a number and a string, JavaScript coerces the number into a string and performs string concatenation.

2. `console.log(3 - "3")`: This will output `0`. JavaScript tries to perform arithmetic operations, so it will try to convert the string `"3"` into a number and subtract it from `3`, resulting in `0`.

3. `console.log(+"3" + 3)`: This will output `6`. The unary plus operator (`+`) converts the string `"3"` into a number, and then adds `3` to it, resulting in `6`.

4. `console.log("3" == 3)`: This will output `true`. The loose equality operator (`==`) performs type coercion, so it converts the string `"3"` into a number before comparing, which results in `true` because `3` is equal to `3`.

5. `console.log("3" === 3)`: This will output `false`. The strict equality operator (`===`) does not perform type coercion, so it compares the string `"3"` with the number `3` directly, resulting in `false` because they are of different types.

6. `console.log(1 < 2 < 3)`: This will output `true`. This expression is evaluated left-to-right. `1 < 2` evaluates to `true`, which is converted to `1` in numerical comparison, so `1 < 3` also evaluates to `true`.

7. `console.log(3 > 2 > 1)`: This will output `false`. This expression is also evaluated left-to-right. `3 > 2` evaluates to `true`, which is converted to `1` in numerical comparison. Then `1 > 1` evaluates to `false`.

8. `console.log(isNaN('12'))`: This will output `false`. The `isNaN()` function checks if a value is "Not-a-Number". However, the string `'12'` can be coerced into a number, so it's not NaN, resulting in `false`.

## 3. Block, Local and Global scope

In the provided JavaScript code:

```javascript
function print() {
  var x = 21;
  let y = 20;
  console.log(window.x);
  console.log(window.y);
}
print();
```

1. Inside the function `print()`, two variables are declared: `x` using `var` and `y` using `let`.
2. Variable `x` is declared using `var`, which means it becomes a property of the global object (`window` object in browsers) because it's declared outside any function or block scope. So, `window.x` will refer to the variable `x` declared using `var`.
3. Variable `y` is declared using `let`, which means it's block-scoped to the `print()` function and not attached to the global object. Therefore, `window.y` will be `undefined`.
4. The function is called `print()`.
5. Inside the function, `console.log(window.x)` will log the value of `x` attached to the global object (`window` in a browser), which is `21`.
6. `console.log(window.y)` will log `undefined` because `y` is not attached to the global object due to being declared with `let`.
7. Therefore, the output of the function will be:

   ```
   21
   undefined
   ```

- In JavaScript, scope refers to the accessibility of variables. There are three types of scopes: block scope, local scope, and global scope. Let me explain each with code examples:

- 1. . **Block Scope**: Introduced in ES6 with the `let` and `const` keywords, block scope confines variables within the nearest curly braces `{}`. Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside a block are only accessible within that block.

```javascript
{
  let x = 10; // block-scoped variable
  console.log(x); // Output: 10
}

console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined
```

- 2. **Local Scope**: Variables declared within a function have local scope. They are accessible only within that function.

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  var y = 20; // local variable
  console.log(y); // Output: 20
}

myFunction();
console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined
```

- 3. **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

```javascript
var z = 30; // global variable

function anotherFunction() {
  console.log(z); // Output: 30
}

console.log(z); // Output: 30
```

```javascript
var globalVariable = 10; // Global variable

function print() {
  var localVariable = 21; // Local variable to the function

  {
    let blockVariable = 22; // Block-scoped variable
    console.log("Inside block:", blockVariable); // Accessible inside the block
  }

  console.log("Inside function - localVariable:", localVariable); // Accessible inside the function
  console.log("Inside function - globalVariable:", globalVariable); // Accessible inside the function
  console.log("Inside function - window.globalVariable:", window.globalVariable); // Accessible inside the function via window object
}

print();

console.log("Outside function - globalVariable:", globalVariable); // Accessible globally
```

Remember, accessing variables in broader scopes (e.g., global from within a function) is allowed, but accessing variables in narrower scopes (e.g., local from outside its function) will result in an error.

## 4. For loop var vs let

#### let in for loop:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
```

1. The `for` loop initializes a block-scoped variable `i` with a value of `0`.
2. It checks the condition `i < 5`.
3. If the condition is `true`, it executes the loop body and increments `i` by `1`.
4. Inside the loop body:
   - `setTimeout()` is used to schedule the execution of a function after a specified delay (in milliseconds).
   - An arrow function is passed to `setTimeout()`, which logs the value of `i` to the console.
   - However, this logging function is not executed immediately; it is scheduled to be executed after a delay of `1000` milliseconds (1 second).
5. This process repeats until the condition `i < 5` becomes `false` (i.e., after `i` reaches `5`).
6. Since `i` is declared using `let`, it's block-scoped, meaning a new lexical environment is created for each iteration of the loop. This ensures that each invocation of the arrow function inside `setTimeout()` captures the value of `i` at the time of its execution.
7. As a result, after 1 second, the logged values will be `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, respectively, as expected. This is because each scheduled execution of the arrow function inside `setTimeout()` captures the value of `i` at the time of its iteration.

#### var in for loop:

In the provided JavaScript code:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
```

1. The `for` loop initializes a variable `i` with a value of `0`.
2. It checks the condition `i < 5`.
3. If the condition is `true`, it executes the loop body and increments `i` by `1`.
4. Inside the loop body:
   - `setTimeout()` is used to schedule the execution of a function after a specified delay (in milliseconds).
   - An arrow function is passed to `setTimeout()`, which logs the value of `i` to the console.
   - However, this logging function is not executed immediately; it is scheduled to be executed after a delay of `1000` milliseconds (1 second).
5. This process repeats until the condition `i < 5` becomes `false` (i.e., after `i` reaches `5`).
6. When the loop finishes executing, the value of `i` will be `5`.

Now, let's discuss the behavior of `setTimeout()` inside the loop:

- Even though `setTimeout()` is called multiple times within the loop, the functions passed to `setTimeout()` are not executed immediately. Instead, they are executed asynchronously after the specified delay.
- Because of the asynchronous nature of `setTimeout()`, by the time the functions passed to it are executed (after a delay of 1 second), the loop has already completed, and the value of `i` has become `5`.
- Since the logging function captures the reference to `i` by closure, it will print the value of `i` at the time of execution, which is `5` for all the scheduled executions.

So, when this code runs, after a delay of 1 second, it will log `5` to the console five times. This is because by the time the logging functions are executed, the loop has already finished executing and the value of `i` is `5`.

#### var + closure = let

Using a closure inside the loop to capture the value of `i` at each iteration. Here's how you can print `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` instead of five times `5` using `var`:

```javascript
for (var i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
  (function (index) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(index);
    }, 1000 * index);
  })(i);
}
```

In this code:

- We use a `for` loop to iterate from `1` to `5`.
- Inside the loop, we immediately invoke a function expression (an IIFE - Immediately Invoked Function Expression) which takes `i` as an argument and captures its value in the parameter `index`.
- We then pass `index` to `setTimeout()` to schedule the logging of `index` after a delay. Since each `setTimeout()` call captures the value of `index` at the time it's invoked, it prints `1` after 1 second, `2` after 2 seconds, and so on, until `5` after 5 seconds.

This way, we print `1 2 3 4 5` to the console using only `var`.

## 5. Assign value then declare concept in JS

In the below JavaScript code:

```javascript
x = 10;
console.log(x);
var x;
```

1. The variable `x` is assigned the value `10` without being declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`. In JavaScript, this is allowed due to the concept of variable hoisting. Hoisting means that variable declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, although their assignments remain in place.
2. When the code is executed, `x` is assigned the value `10`.
3. Then, `console.log(x)` logs the value of `x`, which is `10`.
4. After that, `var x;` is encountered. Despite being declared later in the code, the declaration of `x` with `var` is hoisted to the top of its scope. However, since `x` has already been assigned a value (`10`), this declaration doesn't affect the value of `x`.
5. Therefore, the output of the code will be:
   ```
   10
   ```

---

In the below JavaScript code:

```javascript
x = 10;
y = 10;
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
const y;
let x;
```

1. `x = 10;`: This assigns the value `10` to the variable `x`. Since `x` is not declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`, it becomes a global variable.
2. `y = 10;`: This assigns the value `10` to the variable `y`. Similar to `x`, since `y` is not declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`, it also becomes a global variable.

3. `console.log(x);`: This prints the value of `x` to the console. The value of `x` is `10`.

4. `console.log(y);`: This prints the value of `y` to the console. The value of `y` is also `10`.

5. `const y;`: This line attempts to declare the variable `y` using `const`. However, since `y` has already been assigned a value (`10`) before its declaration, this will result in a syntax error. In JavaScript, `const` requires an initialization at the point of declaration and cannot be assigned a value later.

6. `let x;`: This line declares the variable `x` using `let`. However, since `x` has already been assigned a value (`10`) before its declaration, this will not result in an error. But declaring `x` here will not have any effect on the previously assigned value of `x`.

Therefore, the code will throw a syntax error at the line `const y;` due to the attempt to declare a `const` variable without initialization, and it will output `10` for both `x` and `y` before encountering the error.

## 6. Callback hell and the Solution :

Callback hell refers to the situation where you have multiple nested callbacks within asynchronous JavaScript code, leading to code that is hard to read, understand, and maintain. This typically occurs when you have asynchronous operations dependent on the results of other asynchronous operations, resulting in deeply nested callback functions.

Here's an example of what callback hell might look like:

```javascript
asyncOperation1((result1) => {
  asyncOperation2(result1, (result2) => {
    asyncOperation3(result2, (result3) => {
      // More nested callbacks...
    });
  });
});
```

Asynchronous operations in JavaScript, like fetching data from a server, reading from a file, or waiting for a user interaction, often involve callbacks. When you have multiple asynchronous operations depending on each other, each requiring a callback, the code can become difficult to manage due to the deeply nested structure.

There are several solutions to mitigate callback hell:

1. **Use Named Functions**: Define functions outside of the callback chain and refer to them by name within the callbacks. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

```javascript
function handleResult1(result1) {
  asyncOperation2(result1, handleResult2);
}

function handleResult2(result2) {
  asyncOperation3(result2, handleResult3);
}

asyncOperation1(handleResult1);
```

2. **Use Promises**: Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations and avoid callback hell. Promises allow you to chain asynchronous operations sequentially, making the code more readable and maintainable.

```javascript
asyncOperation1()
  .then((result1) => asyncOperation2(result1))
  .then((result2) => asyncOperation3(result2))
  .then((result3) => {
    // Handle final result
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle errors
  });
```

3. **Use Async/Await**: Async/await is a modern JavaScript feature that allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style. It's built on top of promises and provides a cleaner syntax for handling asynchronous operations.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const result1 = await asyncOperation1();
    const result2 = await asyncOperation2(result1);
    const result3 = await asyncOperation3(result2);
    // Handle final result
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
  }
}

fetchData();
```

Using promises or async/await can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of asynchronous code by flattening the structure and eliminating callback hell. However, it's important to choose the solution that best fits your project's requirements and the JavaScript environment you're working in.
