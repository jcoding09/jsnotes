# Topic 006: Service workers in JS

A Service Worker is a script that runs in the background of the browser, separate from the web page, enabling features that don't need a web page or user interaction. These features include handling network requests, caching assets, and enabling push notifications. Service Workers are a key component of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

### Key Features of Service Workers:

1. **Background Sync**: They allow you to defer actions until the user has stable connectivity.
2. **Push Notifications**: They enable push notifications from the server.
3. **Caching**: They help to cache assets and resources to enable offline access.

### Registering a Service Worker

To use a Service Worker, you must register it in your web page's JavaScript code. The registration process tells the browser where your Service Worker script is located.

#### Example

```javascript
if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener("load", () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register("/service-worker.js")
      .then((registration) => {
        console.log("ServiceWorker registration successful with scope: ", registration.scope);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log("ServiceWorker registration failed: ", error);
      });
  });
}
```

### Writing a Service Worker Script

The Service Worker script handles various events like `install`, `activate`, and `fetch`.

#### Example: `service-worker.js`

```javascript
const CACHE_NAME = "my-cache-v1";
const urlsToCache = ["/", "/styles/main.css", "/script/main.js"];

// Install event
self.addEventListener("install", (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => {
      console.log("Opened cache");
      return cache.addAll(urlsToCache);
    })
  );
});

// Activate event
self.addEventListener("activate", (event) => {
  const cacheWhitelist = [CACHE_NAME];
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.keys().then((cacheNames) => {
      return Promise.all(
        cacheNames.map((cacheName) => {
          if (cacheWhitelist.indexOf(cacheName) === -1) {
            return caches.delete(cacheName);
          }
        })
      );
    })
  );
});

// Fetch event
self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
      // Cache hit - return the cached response
      if (response) {
        return response;
      }
      return fetch(event.request).then((response) => {
        // Check if we received a valid response
        if (!response || response.status !== 200 || response.type !== "basic") {
          return response;
        }

        // Clone the response
        const responseToCache = response.clone();

        caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => {
          cache.put(event.request, responseToCache);
        });

        return response;
      });
    })
  );
});
```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Install Event**:

   - This event is triggered when the Service Worker is installed.
   - In this event, we open a cache and add the specified resources (`urlsToCache`) to it.

2. **Activate Event**:

   - This event is triggered after the Service Worker is installed.
   - It is used to clean up old caches that are no longer needed.

3. **Fetch Event**:
   - This event is triggered for every network request.
   - It intercepts the requests and responds with cached resources if available. If not, it fetches the resource from the network, caches it, and then returns it to the user.

### Benefits:

- **Offline Support**: Users can access the site even when offline.
- **Performance**: Cached resources can be served faster than network requests.
- **Reliability**: Ensures that the latest updates are eventually available even if the user is offline at the time of the update.

By leveraging Service Workers, you can create more resilient, faster, and offline-capable web applications.
