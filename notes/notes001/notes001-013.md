# Topic 013: WeakSets, Nullish Coalescing, and Optional Chaining in JS

we’ll explore three key concepts in JavaScript that are valuable for memory management, logical operations, and working with potentially undefined properties. These concepts are **WeakSets**, the **Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`)**, and the **Optional Chaining Operator (`?.`)**.

#### **WeakSets in JavaScript**

WeakSets are a unique data structure in JavaScript designed specifically for **holding objects**. Unlike regular `Set` objects, a `WeakSet` allows the JavaScript engine to **automatically remove entries** when there are no other references to the objects, helping with memory management through a process called **garbage collection**.

Here's a breakdown of the key features of WeakSets:

- **WeakSets only store objects**, and cannot hold primitive values like numbers, strings, or booleans.
- If an object stored in a `WeakSet` becomes unreachable (meaning no other references exist), the object is automatically removed from the set. This makes `WeakSets` useful in scenarios where you don’t want objects to prevent their own garbage collection.
- WeakSets are **not enumerable**—you can’t loop over the elements in a WeakSet as you can with a normal `Set`.

**Example from the image:**

```javascript
const weakSet = new WeakSet();

const obj1 = {};
const obj2 = {};

weakSet.add(obj1);
weakSet.add(obj2);

console.log(weakSet.has(obj1)); // true
```

In this example, two objects, `obj1` and `obj2`, are added to the WeakSet. If `obj1` becomes unreachable (i.e., no other reference to it exists), it will automatically be removed from `weakSet`.

##### **When to Use WeakSets?**

WeakSets are ideal in situations where you want to **track objects weakly**—allowing their memory to be freed up when no other parts of the code need them. This helps optimize memory usage in long-running applications.

#### **Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`)**

The **nullish coalescing operator (`??`)** is used to assign a **default value** when the left-hand side is either `null` or `undefined`. This operator differs from the logical OR operator (`||`), which also considers falsy values like `0`, `false`, or `""` as triggers for the fallback value.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
let result = value ?? defaultValue;
```

**Example:**

```javascript
let language = null;
let defaultLang = language ?? "ar_SA"; // result: 'ar_SA'
```

In this example, `language` is `null`, so the default `'ar_SA'` is assigned to `defaultLang`.

##### **When to Use `??`?**

Use the `??` operator when you want to provide a default value only when dealing with `null` or `undefined`, without mistakenly overriding other falsy values.

#### **Optional Chaining Operator (`?.`)**

The **optional chaining operator (`?.`)** allows you to safely access deeply nested object properties without worrying about throwing an error if any part of the chain is `null` or `undefined`.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
let result = obj?.property?.subProperty;
```

**Example:**

```javascript
let user = {
  name: "John",
  address: { city: "New York" },
};

let city = user?.address?.city; // 'New York'
let zip = user?.address?.zipCode; // undefined, but no error thrown
```

In this example, using `?.`, you can safely attempt to access `user.address.city`. If `address` were `undefined`, the code would simply return `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

##### **When to Use `?.`?**

The optional chaining operator is particularly useful when working with **API responses** or **complex objects** where certain properties may or may not exist, helping avoid runtime errors.
